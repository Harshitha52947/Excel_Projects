# üõí Sales Database Project

Welcome to the **Sales Database Project** repository. This project is designed for showcasing sales data analytics, Excel-to-CSV conversion workflows, and structured data analysis that can be used for dashboards, reports, or machine learning tasks.

---

## üìÅ Project Overview

This repository includes a dataset originally compiled in an Excel workbook (`sales_database.xlsx`), now exported into two separate CSV files for easier usage and compatibility with data analysis tools and version control platforms like GitHub.
